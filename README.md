## 🔹 What I Built

- Deployed **Splunk Enterprise SIEM** with Linux and Windows log onboarding  
- Integrated **Zeek IDS** for DNS, HTTP, and network traffic visibility  
- Built **SPL detections** for:
  - SSH brute-force attacks  
  - DNS anomalies and suspicious domains  
  - Web exploitation attempts  
- Deployed **Wazuh SIEM** with Windows and Ubuntu agents  
- Validated key SOC use cases:
  - File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)  
  - Brute-force detection  
  - Vulnerability detection  
- Completed the **30 Days SOC Challenge** (SIEM, logs, phishing, malware, threat intelligence)
